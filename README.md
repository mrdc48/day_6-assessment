* First question =>
For (i=1; I<=n; I++){
Console.log("hi");
}

Ans => 'O(n)' => linear time complexity.
 in above question the time complexity depends upon big O(n)
So this is the linear time complexity where the value of n it depends upon the number of inputs given by the user.


* Second Question => 
For (i=1; I<=n; I*=3){
 For (j=1; j<=n; j++){
   Console.log("hi");
 }
}
Ans = 'O(n<sup>2</sup>) '=> quadratic time complexity
We are using the two loops that's why the value of n gets incremented twice.
